Calculated Objects question type
================================

This a Moodle question type which extends the 'calculated' question type.
Teachers can create questions like `How much is {apples} + {oranges}?`
- where the `{wildcards}` become M and N x images of apples and oranges respectively.
It is aimed at pre/primary-school students (approximately age 3-9).

Note, this question type uses the database tables of the 'calculated' question type.

Tested with Moodle 1.9.7, Moodle 2.0.2.


Currently supported wildcards:
 apple, redapple, orange, pear, pineapple, tomato, walnut, cookie, cake, cup, pencil
(each with or without an 's', eg. {cookies} and with an optional differentiator, eg. `{apples_1} + {apples_2}`).
