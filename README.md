Calculated Objects question type
================================

This a Moodle question type which extends the 'calculated' question type.
Teachers can create questions like `How much is {apples} + {oranges}?`
- where the `{wildcards}` become M and N x images of apples and oranges respectively.
It is aimed at pre/primary-school students (approximately age 3-9).

Note, this question type uses the database tables of the 'calculated' question type.

Tested with Moodle 1.9.7, 2.0.2 and 2.2.3.


Currently supported wildcards:
 apple, redapple, orange, pear, pineapple, tomato, walnut, cookie, cake, cup, car pencil
(each with or without an 's', eg. {cookies} and with an optional differentiator, eg. `{apples_1} + {apples_2}`).

Upgrade
-------
To upgrade from previous versions:

2. Delete `{MOODLE}/lang/en_utf8/help/quiz/calculatedobjects.html` (Moodle < 2.0)
3. Follow the install instructions above.

Notes
-----
TODO/ limitations:

* Add support for multiple operators (currently only 1 supported).
* Test with browsers.
* More testing of backup and restore.
* Work on validation functions (qtype_calculatedobjects_find_formula_errors).
* Tidy up.
* If there's demand, add ability to use custom icons/images.
* If there's demand, translation.

* Please look at Moodle documentation about plugins with missing strings in AMOS at https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Translating_plugins#Plugins_with_coding_errors :

The plugin code must not rely on trailing and leading whitespace in strings.
The string file must be considered as pure data file with the syntax $string['id'] = 'value';
No other PHP syntax such as concatenation, heredoc and nowdoc is supported by the tools that AMOS use when processing the strings (even if it may work in Moodle itself).
Use neither string concatenation operators nor other PHP logic inside string files. Those should really be considered as plain data files with simple $string['key'] = 'value'; syntax, nothing more.
